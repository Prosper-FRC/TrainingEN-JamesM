This Repo holds all programming examples for my Engineering Notebooks. The purpose of this repo is to give insight to the subsystems, drives, PIDs, and organization of common programming tasks that are encounterd in FRC. Each Branch will contain an entirely different programming topic that is linked to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yozdqwsymyvhTIpk-ipKWmDyzRhKVnDP?usp=drive_link.

This is an ongoing Repo that is still under Development so expect changes and additions.
